# Uberflip Header and Theme

A responsive custom header with navigation added ontop of <a href="http://www.uberflip.com> an uberflip </a> template. 

Also built a method where a URL parameter (in this case ?vip=yes) gets passed to all links on the page if they are given a link with the parameter in it.  This allows you to give a VIP person a link that ends with ?vip=yes, and that parameter ungates all of the content so they don't need to register anywhere on the site. As they navigate across the site that paramater will be appended to the end of all of the links on the site so every page they navigate to will give them access to ungated content.
